# Weather-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-includes-Quantum-Computing
This project develops a weather prediction system by integrating Machine Learning (ML) and Quantum Computing. Using historical weather data, it employs classical ML models for accurate forecasting and explores quantum-enhanced techniques  to optimize performance. The goal is to predict conditions like temperature and precipitation while benchmarking classical and quantum approaches. Ideal for data scientists and quantum enthusiasts, this repository offers a modular pipeline with preprocessing, modeling, and visualization tools.
